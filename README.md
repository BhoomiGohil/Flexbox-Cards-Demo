# CSS Flexbox Example

This project showcases a responsive webpage built using CSS Flexbox, inspired by Jen Kramerâ€™s course on Front End Master. The design illustrates the advantages of using Flexbox over the float method for creating flexible layouts.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Comparison between Flexbox and float methods
- Updated card radius and padding to enhance the visual appeal based on Jen Kramer's original design

## Visual Design

Here are visual representations of the webpage across different devices:

### Desktop

## Comparison with Float

There are some notable differences between the float and flex methods. You can compare this project with my other repository that implements the float method using the same example. You'll notice that the float method has some flaws, particularly on smaller screen sizes.

## Getting Started

To view the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

```
git clone https://github.com/BhoomiGohil/Flexbox-CardsUI.git
cd Flexbox-CardsUI
```

2. Open the `Index.html` file in your web browser.

```
open Index.html
```

OR

Using Live Server in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Install the Live Server extension:**
   Open Visual Studio Code Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X Search for "Live Server" and click Install

2. Once installed, right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

This will open the project in your browser, and changes made to the code will be reflected automatically.
